History

Second owner from new. First owner was an opera singer who had this an accompanient instrument which was rarely used - consequently the hammers / felts are all original.
Steinway has tuned this piano every 3 months since 2015 - I have the invoices if required. Steinway suggest that the piano is in perfect condition as is - i.e. no remedial work required. I have used the piano v.little - which will be apparent from any review.
